            Initiates the forgot password flow. An email will be sent to the user with a link to reset their password. The link contains a token that is valid for 24 hours and can only be used once.

            The token is a JWT containing the user's id and their email. It's signed with the user's password and the server's secret. This way, the key is automatically invalidated when the password changes.
